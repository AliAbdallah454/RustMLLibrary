# Rust ML Library

The goal of this project is to develop the necessary tools to implement and train neural networks in Rust.

While the aim is not to build a fully-featured machine learning library like PyTorch or TensorFlow, the end goal is to train a digit recognition model using both a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and then compare their performance.

## Project Scope

* Start by defining a matrix structure and implementing basic matrix operations.
* Progress towards implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) that includes backpropagation for training.
* And maybe I'll add support for cuda :)


## Objectives

* Enhance my understanding of neural network algorithms and their training mechanisms.
* Strengthen my skills in Rust and software engineering.


This project will serve as a valuable learning experience in both machine learning concepts and low-level programming with Rust.
